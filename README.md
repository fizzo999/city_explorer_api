# city_explorer_api
code 301 lab6 project - introduction to building a server app

# Project Name

**Author**: Fizzo Pannosch
**Version**: 1.0.2  

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This app is an exercise in connecting a Javascript server (server.js) application to a frontend (cityexploerer) and as a first step take dummy data that lives on our local machine and renders it useful to the front end application where it will be displayed. For that we create 2 routes (/weather and /location) and send the appropriately formatted data.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
setup correct file structure, npm init, npm install -S express dotenv cors, then setup the server.js file

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
we use a Javascript server.js file that utilizes the libraries express and cors and dotenv. We are using locally stored dummy data that is JSON formatted (so it is getting us ready for real outbound server calls)

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples: -->

02-22-2021 4:30pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with two GET routes (/location and /weather on PORT:3000) for the location resource.
